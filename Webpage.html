  <a href="https://www.xmasclock.com">Merry Christmas!</a></p>
  <hr> It's finally Christmas day! I had hoped that it would be perfect and I would get all presents that I asked for but my life always has upside downs. I had hoped for the new airpods pro and begged my parents for it but guess what they got me. SOCKS! Who even likes socks. Socks are for old people. I couln't bleieve I socks instead of airpods! But my parents explaine to me that they were planning to get me a new phone and airpods for birthday so that paid up for the disappointment. I learned that I have to be paient and not get so angry about certain things. I have to stay grateful because some people didn't even get anything.<hr>
